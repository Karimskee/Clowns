Also for inputs that require a string (not sure of those exist) -> eh da

Names:
    - First and last name only -> almost done
    - Only alphabetical characters and a single space -> almost done

Emails:
    - Using the email-validator library (already implemented) -> done by karim
    - If not valid, instantly request again

Password:
    - Use a library for strong password validation  -> almost done
    - If not valid, instantly request again


Classes:
--------
- a class for commands
    commands.doctors -> [-login, -home, -receipts, -unfinished, -finished, -logout, -exit]
    commands.patients = [-help, -login, -register, -home, -schedule, -receipts, -reports, -logout, -exit]

- a class for the session
    session.name
    session.email
    session.type






























































DONE - remove doctor notes from unfinished reports page
DONE - -home after -register and -schedule dispalys "Karim Ghazy" instead of current session username
